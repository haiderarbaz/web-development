    <p><i><b>LinkedIn (/lɪŋktˈɪn/) is a business and employment-focused social media platform that works through
                websites and mobile apps. It was launched on May 5, 2003. Since December 2016, it has been a wholly
                owned subsidiary of Microsoft. The platform is primarily used for professional networking and career
                development, and allows jobseekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs. From 2015 most of the
                company's revenue came from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales
                professionals. LinkedIn has more than 970 million registered members from over 200 countries and
                territories.
