# Day-01 of 30-days of JavaScript

## Overview:

On Day 01 of 30 days of JavaScript, I started learning the basics of JavaScript. I learned variables, data types, and user interaction methods. I also completed practice `tasks `for each topic and worked on some additional `activities` and `feature requests`.

## Topics Covered:

- Introduction
- Variables
- DataTypes
- Interactions

## What I Built

### Tasks

- **[Variables Tasks](./01-variables/tasks/index.html)**
- **[Data Types Tasks](./02-dataTypes/tasks/index.html)**
- **[Interaction: alert, prompt, confirm](./03-interaction/tasks/index.html)**

### Activities & Feature Requests

- **[Activities/Feature Request](./04-tasks/index.html)**

## Reflection

- Learned differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Practiced naming variables and data types and type checking.
- Understood how to interact with users using alert, prompt, and confirm.

## Challenges Faced

- **Understanding the difference between `null` and `undefined`**
- **Deciding when to use `let` vs `const`**

## Time Invested

- Approximately 8-10 hours of learning, taking notes of it and practice.

## Next Steps

- Plan to learn about type conversions and operators in JavaScript on Day-02.
- Practice some small snippets of codes to strengthen understanding.
