<!-- hr tag (horizontal rule) -->
    <hr>
    <!--It is used to create a horizontal line across the page. This line visually separates content, such as dividing sections of a webpage. -->
        <!-- Key Points About <hr>:
            Appearance: It typically renders as a thin horizontal line.
            Self-Closing: The <hr> tag is self-closing, meaning it doesnâ€™t require a closing tag (</hr>).
            Styling: You can style the <hr> using CSS to change its width, color, height, and other properties. -->

<!-- pre tag ("preformatted text"): poet problem -->
    <pre>
        yaaar tera
        superstar
        desi kalakaar
    </pre>
    <!-- It is used to display text exactly as it is written in the HTML code, including spaces, tabs, and line breaks. The text inside the <pre> tag is typically displayed in a monospaced (fixed-width) font, which is often used for displaying code or structured text that needs to maintain its formatting. -->
        <!--Key Points About <pre>:
            Preserves Whitespace: Unlike other HTML elements, the <pre> tag preserves whitespace, tabs, and line breaks.
            Monospaced Font: The content inside a <pre> tag is usually rendered in a monospaced font, where each character takes up the same amount of space.
            Useful for Code: It's commonly used to display code snippets, ASCII art, or any text where spacing is important.  -->
