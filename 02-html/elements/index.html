    <!-- There are two types of elements -->
        <!-- 1.)Block Level Elements -->
        <!-- 2.)Inline Level Elements -->

    <!-- 1.)Block Level Elements:- These elements always start on a new line and take up the entire width of their parent element. They are used to define larger blocks of content, such as paragraphs, headings, and lists. -->
    <div>
        <h1>Block Level Elements</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>heading h1 to h6</li>
            <li>p</li>
            <li>li</li>
            <!-- and more -->
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- 2.)Inline Level Elements:- These elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as their content requires. They are used to define smaller pieces of content, such as text or images, that are integrated into a larger block of text. -->
     <div>
        <h1>Inline Level Elements </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>img</li>
            <li>a</li>
