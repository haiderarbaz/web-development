# 🧩 Project: Simple “Task Logger” App

📝 What It Does:

- Lets you add and view tasks (like a tiny to-do list).

- Each task is saved in a text file (using a core module).

- You’ll create your own helper function (a local module).

- You’ll use a third-party module for colored console output.

**Note:**

- Install a thirdy-party package `chalk`
- `chalk` helps you print colorful text in the console.
