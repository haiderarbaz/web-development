What is components?
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

 Types of components:
 1.) Class based Components.
 Syntax:
 first:
    class App extends React.Component{
        render(){
            return <h1>Hello There</h1>
        }
    }

second:
    import{Component} from "react";
    class App extends Component{
        render(){
            return <h1>Hello There</h1>
        }
    }

 2.) Fuction based components
 Syntax:
    function Component(){
        return(
            <div>Component</div>
        )
    }
    export default Component

JSX (JS XML or JavaScript XML): 
    JSX allows us to write HTML in REact.
    JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

    Rules to write JSX:
    JSX expressions must have one parent element.
    Must Close the tags.

Expressions In JSX:
    With JSX you can write expressions inside curly braces. The expression can be a React variable, or property, or any other valid JavaScript expression.
    JSX will execute the expressions and return the result.
